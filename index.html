    <h2>Welcome to TAG TEAM: A Soft Skills Development Game</h2>
    <p><strong>TAG TEAM</strong> is an entertaining yet interactive game for learning and understanding key soft skills in undergraduate students. Realistically placed in a workplace scenario, it puts the players into the role of an assistant manager at Orbit Corp, a consultancy firm, to navigate through various scenarios that will put their leadership, communication, problem-solving, and decision-making skills to test.</p>
    
    <h3>Overview of the Game</h3>
    <p>The story begins when the player plays the role of an assistant manager who is supposed to take the onus on his shoulders as the manager Stacy is not available. The player will have to get briefings from the CEO Dylan and must manage the team at this critical juncture. Throughout the game, decisions need to be made amidst various situations that arise, and interactions with team members must be done while keeping company interests in mind.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Competencies Tested</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Leadership and Communication:</strong> Players must handle the team, distribute responsibilities, and ensure everyone is on the same page. They will learn to avoid problems by emphasizing good communication and team dynamics. For example, team members will point out unequal workloads and encourage collaboration.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Problem-Solving and Decision Making:</strong> Players must make key decisions when challenges arise, such as printer failures or staff disagreements. The choices they make affect team morale and productivity, enhancing critical thinking and demonstrating the long-term impact of their decisions.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Empathy and Conflict Resolution:</strong> Players must understand the situations of team members, such as when Ann requests time off for her sonâ€™s school presentation. The player faces the dilemma of balancing workplace demands with sensitivity toward their colleagues.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Ethical Decision-Making:</strong> In one scenario, the player must choose between accepting a managerial position in Sydney or supporting Stacy, who has more experience. This decision highlights the importance of humility and prioritizing team success over personal gain.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Structure of Gameplay</h3>
    <p>The game is structured in chapters, each focusing on particular skills through choices and decisions. Players engage in dialogues, make key decisions, and receive feedback. This interactive format promotes reflection and encourages players to evaluate their choices and experiences as they progress through the game.</p>

    <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
    <p><strong>TAG TEAM</strong> prepares students for real-world challenges by fostering the development of soft skills such as team building, emotional intelligence, and self-efficacy. By simulating a dynamic working environment, players learn to recognize their strengths and weaknesses and improve their strategies. The game emphasizes the importance of collaboration and communication in achieving collective success.</p>

    <p>In essence, <strong>TAG TEAM</strong> combines gameplay with the development of critical soft skills. It immerses players in workplace dynamics, helping them build confidence and resilience while teaching them how to overcome challenges. By providing real-life scenarios, the game serves as a valuable tool for both academic and professional growth.</p>
